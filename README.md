Hate Speech BERT Classifier for CS72: Advanced Computational Linguistics

The goal of our model is to correctly classify three types of speech: hate speech, offensive speech, and neither. More specifically, our model will take in a chunk of text and return predictions for what class the language falls underâ€”2 for hate speech, 1 for offensive speech, and 0 for neither. We will then build a Chrome extension to put our model in action and allow concerned internet users to use our classifier to block out hate speech on the web.
